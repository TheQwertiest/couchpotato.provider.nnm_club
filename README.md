# couchpotato.provider.nnm_club
Custom plugin for Nnm-Club integration in CouchPotato

#How-to install

1. Go to your custom_plugins folder, which is located within your config folder.
See Settings->About->Directories (second folder is your config folder) for location.
2. Make a folder named 'nnm_club' in your custom_plugins folder
3. Place the init.py and main.py file inside this folder.

#How-to use

Once installed as above, go about activating the provider as you would with any other provider in CouchPotato.

You might have to set proxy in CouchPotato settings, since NoNaMe Club is blocked in some countries.
